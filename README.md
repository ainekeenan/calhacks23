Oftentimes, I am feeling a certain way that only a sentence can describe, not one emotion. Playlists never seem to be able to comfort me during this time. They seem to generic and based for someone else, not me. The Spotify DJ uses my top songs that I am sick of and jumps from emotion to emotion. I wanted to change this and allow for users to input a sentence, log into spotify, and get a playlist.

To run: 
cd into server
npm install 
npm start

cd into frontend
npm install 
npm start

enjoy!
